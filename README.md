# Go Server

This is my first Go project. It's quite simple, but it will help me learn the concepts I need to work with it.

## Development Environment (Local)

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have all the below installed:

- [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)

### Initializing the web server

The server will run on port 8080. Then you must access the url `http://localhost:8080`

#### To directly run the main file use the command (in the root folder):

```
go run main.go
```

#### To run the compiled binaries:

- On MacOs or Linux:
```
./go-server
```
- On windows
```
go-server.exe
```
